Please find my completed technical test.

My next steps would have been to add some more styling but I felt it more prudent to show the ability to get the releavnt information from the json file rather than spending too much time on the styles.

In order to run these files locally you will need to download a local server. 

You could use XAMPP which works on Linux, Windows and MacOS or you could use MAMP that works on both Windows and MacOS. I use MAMP on my Macbook Pro.

Download one of these servers using on of the following links:

XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
MAMP: https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/

Install the server following the instructions and then download these files and add them into the 'htdocs' folder in your chosen local server.

Once you have done this, lauch the server and you should thne be able to see the output of these PHP files.
